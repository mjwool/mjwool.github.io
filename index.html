                  <p>  Four decades ago, a small family-operated knitting mill sprung to life in the industrial, Melbourne suburb of Fitzroy.  For the next 35 years the wool mills turned yarn to soft merino wool fabric that was cut, sewn and packaged as beautiful merino wool thermal wear, and distributed to a fiercely loyal Australian and international customer base.</p>
                    <p>
The tenacious, Melbourne Wool Mills became a much loved icon. As a unique manufacturing centre for quality Australian made thermal undergarments, the wool mills achieved some notable milestones along the way, including contributions to various Olympic Games and successful government contracts. The wool mills’ popularity  grew rapidly among the loyal, Melbourne Greek community, who swiftly spread the word, and staunchly supported this much loved manufacturer of their favourite Australian merino wool thermal wear.  </p>
<p>
As the largest supplier of Australian merino wool thermal, active and leisure wear, Merino &amp; Jumbuck embraces the history behind our wonderful, old wool mills.  Through its acquisition of the mills in 2013, Merino &amp; Jumbuck continues to build on the their legacy of producing exceptional, uniquely Australian, merino wool thermal garments, with a growing collection of beautiful clothing and accessories. </p>
                    <p>
Merino &amp; Jumbuck’s new location at the iconic Brunswick site of manufacturing giant Prestige -Holeproof, has merged our treasured history with a historic landmark, creating the perfect home for Merino &amp; Jumbuck’s proud Australian manufacturing future.</p>

                  <p>  Thermo Fleece® thermal wear is made from the finest 100% pure Australian merino wool. Thermo Fleece® is warm, lightweight and breathable, providing superior softness and exceptional comfort in cool or warm weather. </p><p>
Thermo Fleece® pure wool thermal wear actively responds to your body’s temperature. Natural moisture absorption properties inherent in the wool fibres ensure superior comfort, keeping your body dry and odour-free. The fibres in a Thermo Fleece® merino wool garment contain up to 2,000 porous membranes per inch.  When knitted into underwear, these tiny membranes create millions of microscopic air pockets allowing for optimal temperature control and evaporation of moisture.  </p>

<p>
Thermo Fleece®  is available in both 100% pure Australian merino wool and premium wool-rich blends.  </p>
